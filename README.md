# Create-Visualizations-using-Matplotlib-Seaborn-Folium

## Project: Create Visualizations using Matplotlib, Seaborn & Folium with Python

### Project Overview
This project is part of the **IBM Data Science Professional Certificate**. The goal is to **create meaningful visualizations** using Python libraries such as **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn**, and **Folium**. These visualizations help explore, understand, and communicate insights from data effectively.

Through this project, you'll learn to build **static, statistical, and interactive maps**, making data interpretation easier for decision-making.

---

### Objectives
- Learn to create **basic and advanced plots** using Matplotlib.  
- Use Seaborn to visualize **statistical relationships and distributions**.  
- Build **interactive maps** using Folium to analyze geographical data.  
- Explore and communicate insights from datasets using Python visualizations.  

---

### Tools and Technologies
- **Python** – Data analysis and visualization  
- **Matplotlib** – Basic and customized plots (line, bar, scatter, histogram, etc.)  
- **Seaborn** – Advanced statistical visualizations (heatmaps, boxplots, pairplots, etc.)  
- **Folium** – Interactive maps for geospatial data visualization  
- **Pandas & NumPy** – Data manipulation and preprocessing  
- **Jupyter Notebook** – Analysis workflow and documentation  

---

### Example Visualizations
- Line plots, bar charts, and histograms with **Matplotlib**  
- Boxplots, violin plots, pairplots, and heatmaps with **Seaborn**  
- Interactive maps with markers, choropleths, and popups using **Folium**
